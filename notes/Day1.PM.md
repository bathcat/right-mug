## Review
3. `git branch`
* Branch: Copy of a repo
* Best practice: Make a new branch for *everything*.
* Results: Lists branches

4. `git status`
* Gives you current state of:
  - Working area (in red)
  - Staging area (in green)
* What branch you're on
* Merge in progress
* Status relative to origin.

8. `git pull`
* Find stuff on github (that you don't have)
* Details:
  - Git fetch 
  - Git merge
  
9. `git fetch`
- Find changes on gitub
- (Don't merge them in.)

1. `git clone https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle`
- Takes a (probably public) repo, brings it down locally
- First time

6. `git merge some-thing-here`
* Take changes from branch called 'some-thing-here'
* Bring them into current branch

2. `git checkout -b some-thing-here`
* Makes a new branch called 'some-thing-here'

7. `git push`
* Moves local, committed changes to the public repo (like github)

5. `git commit -am'Lorem ipsum.'`
* Commits changes to the local repo
* Includes the commit message
* Flag `a` automatically moves it through the staging area.
