# Lab: Git Practice

## Overview

You're working on a new project, and your job is to set up the repository on github, and the first step is to add these informative notes to README.md:

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing
> elit. Donec et tempus mauris, vel condimentum lorem.
> Praesent a nisi odio. Mauris vel magna tincidunt,
> imperdiet lacus nec, varius justo. 

The sprint backlog item ID is _8392_

## Requirements
1. Create a new public repository on Github. (You've probably done this already.) **Share the link with everyone on slack.**

2. Clone the repository to your hard drive.

3. Create a new branch to hold the changes for this work item.

4. Make the changes outlined above.

5. Merge the changes from your feature branch into main.

6. Push the changes to your public repository.
